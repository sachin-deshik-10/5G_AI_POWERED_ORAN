# Project Governance

This document outlines the governance structure and decision-making processes for the AI-Powered 5G Open RAN Optimizer project.

## Project Mission

To develop an open-source, AI-powered optimization platform for 5G Open RAN networks that enhances performance, reduces costs, and accelerates innovation in telecommunications.

## Governance Structure

### Project Leadership

#### Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

- **Role**: Strategic technical direction and architecture decisions
- **Composition**: 3-5 experienced contributors
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Define technical roadmap
  - Review and approve major architectural changes
  - Resolve technical disputes
  - Maintain coding standards and best practices

#### Project Maintainers

- **Role**: Day-to-day project management and code review
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Review and merge pull requests
  - Manage releases and versioning
  - Moderate community discussions
  - Ensure code quality and testing standards

#### Core Contributors

- **Role**: Regular contributors with commit access
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Contribute code, documentation, and tests
  - Participate in technical discussions
  - Help mentor new contributors
  - Support community engagement

## Decision-Making Process

### Consensus-Based Decisions

- Most decisions are made through community consensus in GitHub discussions
- All community members can participate in discussions
- Decisions are documented in GitHub issues or discussions

### Voting Process

For major decisions requiring formal voting:

1. **Proposal**: Submit detailed proposal in GitHub discussion
2. **Review Period**: Minimum 7-day review period for community feedback
3. **Voting**: TSC members vote (+1, 0, -1) with required rationale
4. **Decision**: Majority vote with at least 3 participating TSC members
5. **Documentation**: Decision recorded in project documentation

### Types of Decisions

#### Consensus Decisions

- Feature additions and improvements
- Bug fixes and optimizations
- Documentation updates
- Community guidelines changes

#### Voting Decisions

- Major architectural changes
- Addition/removal of dependencies
- Release timeline changes
- Governance changes
- TSC membership changes

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Technical Steering Committee

#### Current Members

- TBD (To be established by initial contributors)

#### Selection Process

- Nominated by existing TSC members or maintainers
- Must have significant technical contributions to the project
- Approved by majority vote of existing TSC
- Term length: 2 years, renewable

#### Responsibilities

- Set technical vision and roadmap
- Review major design proposals
- Resolve technical conflicts
- Maintain project quality standards

### Maintainers

#### Criteria for Maintainership

- Demonstrated expertise in project domain
- Consistent high-quality contributions over 6+ months
- Strong communication and collaboration skills
- Commitment to project values and community standards

#### Selection Process

- Nominated by existing maintainers or TSC
- Evaluated based on technical merit and community involvement
- Approved by TSC vote

### Contributors

#### Becoming a Contributor

- Submit high-quality pull requests
- Participate constructively in community discussions
- Follow project guidelines and standards
- Demonstrate commitment to project goals

## Communication Channels

### Primary Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: Technical discussions and questions
- **Pull Requests**: Code review and collaboration

### Community Guidelines

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on technical merit
- Provide constructive feedback
- Follow the Code of Conduct

## Release Management

### Release Cycle

- **Major Releases**: Every 6 months
- **Minor Releases**: Monthly or as needed
- **Patch Releases**: As needed for critical fixes

### Release Process

1. **Planning**: TSC defines release scope and timeline
2. **Development**: Feature development and testing
3. **Stabilization**: Bug fixes and performance optimization
4. **Release**: Version tagging, documentation, and announcement

### Version Numbering

Following Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

## Conflict Resolution

### Technical Disputes

1. **Discussion**: Open discussion in GitHub issues/discussions
2. **Mediation**: Maintainer or TSC member facilitates resolution
3. **Escalation**: TSC voting if consensus cannot be reached
4. **Final Decision**: TSC decision is binding

### Code of Conduct Violations

1. **Reporting**: Report to maintainers or TSC via private email
2. **Investigation**: Confidential investigation by maintainers/TSC
3. **Action**: Appropriate response based on severity
4. **Appeal**: Process for appealing decisions

## Project Roadmap

### Short-term Goals (3-6 months)

- Stable core optimization algorithms
- Comprehensive testing framework
- Documentation and tutorials
- Community building

### Medium-term Goals (6-12 months)

- Advanced AI/ML capabilities
- Integration with major RAN vendors
- Performance benchmarking suite
- Industry partnerships

### Long-term Vision (1-2 years)

- Production-ready enterprise deployment
- Standardization contributions
- Research collaborations
- Ecosystem development

## Modification Process

This governance document can be modified through:

1. **Proposal**: Submit changes via GitHub discussion
2. **Review**: Community review period (minimum 14 days)
3. **Vote**: TSC approval required (majority vote)
4. **Implementation**: Update documentation and communicate changes
