The following is an overview of the architecture of our network management system:

## High-level architecture
Our network management system consists of four main components:

1. Data preparation: this component is responsible for collecting raw data from various sources and transforming it into a format that can be used by our predictive network planning and energy efficiency optimization components.

2. Predictive network planning: this component is responsible for using machine learning algorithms to predict network traffic and identify potential network bottlenecks. It uses the data prepared by the data preparation component.

3. Energy efficiency optimization: this component is responsible for optimizing network traffic to reduce energy consumption. It also uses the data prepared by the data preparation component.

4. Anomaly detection: this component is responsible for detecting anomalies in network traffic and alerting network operators if necessary. It uses the raw data collected by the data preparation component.
