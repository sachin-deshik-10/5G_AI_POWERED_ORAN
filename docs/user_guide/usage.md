Welcome to the user guide for the Network Optimization System. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to use the system to optimize your network resources and improve performance.

## Getting Started
Before you can use the Network Optimization System, you must first install the necessary dependencies and configure the system. Please refer to the installation guide for detailed instructions on how to do this.

Once you have installed the system, you can start using it to optimize your network resources. The system provides a command-line interface (CLI) that you can use to interact with the various components of the system.

### Data Preprocessing
Before you can optimize your network resources, you must first preprocess your data. This involves cleaning, transforming, and normalizing your data to ensure that it is in a format that can be used by the optimization models.

To preprocess your data, you can use the data preprocessing component of the system. This component provides a set of sub-tasks, including data cleaning, data transformation, and data normalization, that you can use to preprocess your data.

### Data Extraction
Once you have preprocessed your data, you can extract the relevant data from various sources, such as sensors, logs, and databases. The data extraction component of the system provides a set of sub-tasks, including data collection, data integration, and data validation, that you can use to extract your data.

### Network Optimization
With your preprocessed and extracted data, you can now use the network optimization component of the system to optimize your network resources in real-time based on the changing network conditions. This component provides a set of sub-tasks, including network monitoring, network modeling, and network optimization, that you can use to optimize your network resources.

### Energy Efficiency Optimization
