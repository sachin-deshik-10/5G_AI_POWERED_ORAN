```

Types:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Code Review Process

1. All submissions require review
2. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose
3. Reviewers will check for:
   - Code quality and style
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation updates
   - Performance implications
   - Security considerations

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Aim for >90% code coverage
- Use pytest fixtures for common test data
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Tests

- Test API endpoints thoroughly
- Test Azure deployment scenarios
- Test data pipeline end-to-end

### Performance Tests

- Benchmark critical algorithms
- Test scalability with large datasets
- Monitor memory usage and latency

## üìö Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update docstrings for all modified functions
- Add examples for new features
- Update API documentation as needed

## üîí Security
